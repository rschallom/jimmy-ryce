<p>Another child is dead. This time, a brown-haired, brown-eyed girl, a year younger than Jimmy Ryce.</p>

<p>A 1999 law passed after Jimmy was raped and murdered at age 9 is meant to protect Floridians from sex offenders by keeping the most dangerous locked up after they finish their prison sentences.</p>

<p>But an eight-month Sun Sentinel investigation into the law named in Jimmy’s memory has uncovered shocking failures. Florida’s safeguards have broken down at every stage, setting hundreds of rapists and child molesters free to harm again.<p>

  	<p>The newspaper’s investigation found:</p>

<p class="noindent"><i class="icon-circle"></i> For every sex offender the state has committed under the <a class="various" data-fancybox-type="iframe" href="review/jimmy.html">14-year-old Ryce law,</a> two others have been released — only to be arrested again for a sex crime.</p> 

<p class="noindent"><i class="icon-circle"></i> From South Florida to the Panhandle, these men have cut a fresh trail of pain, molesting more than 460 children, raping 121 women, and killing 14.</p>

<p class="noindent"><i class="icon-circle"></i> Many offenders attacked again only days after Florida let them go. Six found new victims the same day they walked out the prison gates.</p>

<p>“There are too many people like that out walking around the street,’’ said Victoria, 32, of Central Florida, who was raped and tortured in 2001 by a sex offender the state released 11 months earlier. “This law isn’t working.’’</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="row-fluid" class="infinite-container">
<div class="span6 offset1" id="story" class="infinite-item">	
<p>After reviewing the Sun Sentinel’s findings, the head of the agency that screens sex offenders said she would investigate what changes should be made.</p>

<p>Esther Jacobo said the Department of Children & Families would analyze a sample of reoffenders the newspaper identified to determine what went wrong as it reviews the program from top to bottom.</p>

<p>“The only thing I can hope is that we come up with something better so that we get a larger percentage of these guys not to hurt people anymore,’’ said Jacobo, the agency’s interim secretary. “The biggest wish would be that we could stop it all. I’m not naive enough to think that that’s going to happen, but I think we can do better.’’</p> 

<p>Some changes already are under way. The department has convened a team of mental health experts to review how Florida identifies sex predators. And, on a single day in June, the agency suddenly recommended continued confinement for 19 sex offenders — as many as it had in all of 2012.</p> 

<p>Those actions came too late to protect 8-year-old Cherish Perrywinkle.</p>

<p>This summer, Jacksonville mourned the little girl who was abducted from a Walmart, raped and strangled, her 60-pound body dumped behind a church.</p>

<p>Her accused killer: A registered sex offender freed three weeks earlier.</p>

<p>“A beautiful 8-year-old girl - it shouldn't have happened,” Pastor Steve Dobbs told the crowd assembled for Cherish’s funeral.</p>

<p>Nearly two decades ago, a grisly discovery on a Miami-Dade avocado farm led to a law that should have protected Cherish. </p>

<p>In planters covered in cement, police discovered the dismembered remains of Jimmy Ryce. He’d been kidnapped, raped and shot, and though the farmhand who abducted him had no prior sex crime convictions, Florida’s elected officials vowed to protect the public from predators. </p>

<p>The <a class="various" data-fancybox-type="iframe" href="review/jimmy.html">law they named for Jimmy</a> requires the state to evaluate convicted sex criminals before they are released from prison, and to recommend dangerous predators — those with a mental disorder that makes them likely to reoffend — for lock up at a treatment center in Central Florida.</p>

<p>Offenders are court-ordered to the center after being identified through a screening by the state’s Department of Children & Families, a psychological evaluation and a trial.</p> 

<p>“No child should endure what Jimmy Ryce did,’’ then-Gov. Lawton Chiles said when he signed the bill into law. But those solemn hopes have proved elusive. </p>

<p>Mining records in state databases, police reports and court documents, the Sun Sentinel found: At least 594 offenders reviewed under the law and let go have been convicted of a new sex offense in Florida. Nearly one quarter of them attacked again within six months of being released.</p>

<p>And these numbers do not paint a complete picture. They do not include men convicted in other states or federal court, those who committed non-sexual violent crimes such as murder or home invasion, and those arrested but still awaiting trial for new sex crimes.</p>

<p>“One person reoffending when you have innocent victims is too many,’’ said Dr. Michal Harris, a North Florida veterinarian whose employee was murdered in 2007 by a sex predator who had been freed by the state.</p> 


<p>“This will continue to happen until such a time as the community decides that they are tired of having their wives and their daughters and their sisters raped and beaten to death by people who have done it before and who were released.’’</p>

<p>What follows are the stories of five predators the state had a chance to stop — but chose to set free.</p>

<h3>“Some of us just don’t belong in society... I don't’’</h3>

<p>GRACEVILLE — Inside a prison in this North Florida city, a twice-convicted rapist said the state never should have let him go.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="row-fluid" class="infinite-container">
<div class="span6 offset1" id="story" class="infinite-item">
<p>“This is where I belong,’’ said Michael Dochterman, 43. “It’s the only way to keep control on me.’’</p>

<p>Dochterman moved from Iowa to South Florida as a teenager when his father, a stuntman, got a job on the set of “Miami Vice.’’ He started stealing cars and bicycles at 11 and spent much of his youth in and out of lock-ups.</p>

<p>After robbing, raping and beating his former girlfriend, he entered prison in 1992 at age 22.</p>

<p>Before his release in 2010, the state looked at <a class="various" data-fancybox-type="iframe" href="review/dochterman.html"> Dochterman</a> under the Jimmy Ryce law and chose not to commit him to the state's sex predator treatment center. “I went to see my counselor,’’ Dochterman recalled. “He said, ‘Look, they’re just going to let you out.’ ’’</p>

<p>Dochterman wound up in Pensacola and met a stripper with a 15-year-old daughter. He worked as a tattoo artist and bouncer.</p>

<p>“I had been 20 years in prison,’’ he said. “I hadn’t been around women in forever.’’</p>

<p>One night in July 2011, less than a year after his release, Dochterman entered the bedroom of his girlfriend’s daughter.</p>

<p>“[He] started choking me and telling me to take off all my clothes,’’ she later testified. “I was kicking and scratching and doing anything I can. . .He grabbed the knife and started stabbing me.’’</p>

<p>Dochterman plunged the knife into her body nine times, puncturing her lung. High on pills and alcohol, he said, he now barely remembers the attack.</p>

<p>Convicted of rape for the second time, Dochterman is serving a life sentence at Graceville Correctional Facility.</p>

<p>In a jailhouse interview, he said the state should have looked closer at him under the Jimmy Ryce law before setting him free after his first prison term.</p>

<p>Sex offenders like Dochterman, with just one prior offense and a victim he knew, are considered less dangerous by screeners with the state Department of Children & Families. They didn’t even meet with him face to face. They simply reviewed his files and found he did not qualify as a sex predator.</p>

<p>“I take full responsibility for what happened,’’ said Dochterman. “Some of us just don’t belong in society. I mean, I'm being honest. I don’t.’’</p>

<p>LAKE CITY — Anthony Brewton didn’t fit the state’s profile of a sex predator either, despite this note placed in his file by screeners trying to assess his threat to the public:</p>

<p>“Committed (sex acts) with 12-year-old victim at knifepoint in a wooded area. Threatened to cut her throat and bury her.’’</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="row-fluid" class="infinite-container">
<div class="span6 offset1" id="story" class="infinite-item">
<p>But the state did look at him more closely than Dochterman. Screeners reviewed <a class="various" data-fancybox-type="iframe" href="review/brewton.html"> Brewton’s files</a> and moved him to the second stage of the Ryce commitment process, which is testing and evaluation by a private psychologist under contract to the state.</p>

<p>Psychologist Ada Ramirez found Brewton did not qualify for commitment as a sex predator. The reasons are unclear; Ramirez declined to discuss specific cases.</p> 

<p>After five years in prison, Brewton was a free man.</p>

<p>Three months later, in Atlantic Beach near Jacksonville, a 70-year-old woman found him naked in her kitchen.</p>

<p>Brewton grabbed a knife from a counter and stabbed her twice in the neck.</p>

<p>She screamed and pleaded: “Please don’t do this. I have a heart condition,’’ a police report said. “Please let me get to my oxygen.’’</p>

<p>Brewton forced her into the living room and raped her. For his final act, he slit her throat.</p>

<p>Police found the woman, gasping for air, on a blood-soaked couch.</p> 

<p>She survived. Brewton went back to prison, convicted of rape and attempted murder.</p>

<p>At Columbia Correctional Institution in North Florida, where he is now serving a 30-year sentence, Brewton told the Sun Sentinel that he and another man, who was never charged, broke into what they thought was an empty house to steal “what we could, get us some dope.’’</p>

<p>A high school dropout from Jacksonville, Brewton says his problems began when he quit school in 10th grade, left home and started selling drugs in the streets.</p>

<p>Now 41, he spends his time writing and reflecting on his elderly victim.</p>

<p>“Every day, I have regrets that she got hurt,’’ he said. “I done ask for forgiveness a million times.’’</p>

<h3>“He shouldn’t have been released’’</h3>

<p>PAHOKEE — A neighbor found Ophelia Redden’s body under a melaleuca tree two blocks from the home where she raised three children.</p>

<p>Suspicion soon turned to a local man released from the state’s sex predator treatment center just seven months earlier.</p>

<p>“That guy there should have never been back out," said Edward Turner, Redden’s lifelong friend.</p>

<p>James “Nardo” Harmon had long been “bad news” in the impoverished farm town, Turner said. A member of the South Side Boys gang, he ran afoul of the law early, breaking into homes and raping, court records show. One of his victims was just 11.</p>

<p>At 19, Harmon went to prison for two rapes. After serving 13 years, he was scheduled to get out, and prosecutors sought to commit him under the Jimmy Ryce law.</p>

<p>Two psychologists assessing Harmon for the state found him a high risk for attacking again. A Palm Beach County jury designated him a sexually violent predator, committing him to the treatment center in the summer of 2008.</p>

<p>But during an annual review of his case in 2010, Palm Beach Circuit Judge John Hoy ruled the state could no longer prove Harmon’s “mental condition remains such that it is not safe for [him] to be at large.’’</p>

<p>Hoy, who has retired, could not be reached for comment.</p>

<p>By summer 2010, Harmon was a free man. He returned to Pahokee, moving into a nonprofit housing complex for sex offenders. He got married.</p>

<p>Harmon had been out about six months when Redden, 52, confided her fears to Turner.</p>

<p>She said Harmon was “threatening her’’ for sex, Turner recalled in an interview. “He told her he was going to take it.’’</p>

<p>A week later, in January 2011, Redden was dead.

<h3>“You should get only so many chances’’</h3>

<p>ORANGE PARK — Michael R. Jackson was confined to the sex predator treatment center after attempting attacks on two women and raping a 14-year-old at knifepoint.</p>

<p>After five years of treatment at the center, two evaluators chosen by Jackson’s attorney concluded the danger he posed had diminished. In December 2005, prosecutors agreed to release him with certain conditions, including that he continue sex-offender treatment.</p>

<p>“I think somebody raped her and killed her,” a sobbing coworker <a class="fancybox-media" href="http://vimeo.com/72458144"><i class="icon-facetime-video"></i> told a 911 operator.</a> “She doesn’t have any pulse.”</p>

<p>Police said Jackson attacked the 25-year-old vet technician while she <a class="fancybox-media" href="http://vimeo.com/72459354"><i class="icon-facetime-video"></i> worked alone,</a> prepping the clinic for surgery. He sexually assaulted her, bludgeoned her with a fire extinguisher, and strangled her so violently he broke her neck.</p>

<p>Jackson, now 43, was convicted of rape and murder and sentenced to die. But the Florida Supreme Court overturned his conviction because the jury heard improper evidence, and a retrial is scheduled this fall.</p>

<p>Boyer’s boss, Dr. Michal Harris, knew little of the Jimmy Ryce law before her employee’s murder but is now well-informed.</p>

<p>“The people who are deciding whether or not these guys get loose, they’re gambling with people’s lives,” Harris said. “There aren’t any higher stakes, are there? Innocent lives, innocent victims — children, women.”</p>

<p>Dean Cauley, one of two mental health experts who endorsed Jackson’s release, said the case epitomizes the shortcomings of the Jimmy Ryce law. Jackson scored low on commonly used risk-assessment tools and received favorable reviews from mental health staff who treated him, said Cauley, of Port Charlotte.</p>

<p>“This is why the law doesn’t work because everything you look at with Mr. Jackson would tell you his risk had been reduced,” he said.</p>

<p>The other evaluator, psychologist Harry Krop of Gainesville, told the Sun Sentinel: “Mr. Jackson was a pretty well-behaved person. He had gone through all the phases, didn’t have anywhere else to go in terms of the treatment. . . When you look back, obviously we didn’t predict that well.’’</p>

<p>The girl Jackson raped years earlier learned that he had attacked again from the TV news. Now 42, she was just 14 when he broke in through a sliding glass door, held a pillow over her face and assaulted her.</p>

<p>“I was watching the news and his picture came up. I couldn’t even talk,’’ she told the Sun Sentinel. “The fact that he got out and was able to kill this girl, I think you should only get so many chances.’’</p>

<h3>“We need to blame the law’’</h3>

<p>JACKSONVILLE — The man accused of killing Cherish Perrywinkle could be the poster child of the sexual predator the Jimmy Ryce law was designed to stop.</p>

<p>In and out of jail since the 1970s, Donald J. Smith had a history of exposing himself to children. He lured young girls to his car and tried to kidnap them. He made obscene phone calls to a child and impersonated a social worker, trying to persuade the girl’s grandmother to bring her to a McDonald’s to meet him.</p>

<p>The state had two chances to commit Smith to the sex predator treatment center. Both failed. In the first, Smith was released because prosecutors dropped the case in 2002 in return for Smith agreeing to certain terms, including outpatient counseling and injections of a drug known to reduce sexual urges in pedophiles.</p>

<p>Smith returned to prison in 2004 on a conviction for dealing in stolen property. He came up for scrutiny under the Jimmy Ryce law again in 2006 but went free after a psychological evaluation and <a class="various" data-fancybox-type="iframe" href="review/smith.html"> a review</a> by a team from the Department of Children & Families found he wasn’t a sexually violent predator. Records released by the agency do not provide a reason.</p>

<p>Smith could have been reviewed a third time, following his 2009 arrest for impersonating the social worker. But prosecutors reduced the charges from felonies to misdemeanors because the child’s family did not want her to testify. That sent Smith to jail instead of prison, and only prison inmates get Jimmy Ryce reviews.</p>

<p>Smith had been out of jail on that case just three weeks when 8-year-old <a class="fancybox-buttons" data-fancybox-group="button3" rel="gallery3" href="img/cherish1.jpg" title="Cherish Perrywinkle, 8, was abducted, raped and strangled June 21.">

<p>On June 21, Smith befriended the second-grader and her mother, Rayne, at a Dollar General store and drove them to a Walmart. He told the mother “he was going to buy clothes for [Cherish] and her because he saw they were having a hard time,” a Jacksonville sheriff’s report says.</p>

<p>After two hours of shopping, according to investigators, Smith told the mother he was taking Cherish to a McDonald’s in the store. Instead, investigators said, he led the child to the parking lot and whisked her away in his van.</p>

<p>Police search dogs found her body 10 hours later in the woods behind a church.</p>

<p>“Why is he out? Why?” asked Beverly McClain, of Jacksonsville, wiping away tears as she stood before a memorial to the little girl who loved to ride her bike, play school with her two younger sisters and draw pictures of smiling girls. “She was an innocent baby. When’s it going to stop?”</p>

<p>At the Paxon Revival Center Church, where Cherish occasionally worshiped and sang in the children’s ministry, her mother wailed at the sight of her daughter’s lavender coffin.</p>

<p>From a stage with a full band and the congregation on its feet, Dobbs, the pastor, said Florida failed Cherish.</p>

<p>“I know you want to blame the judge and you want to blame mama and you want to blame the cops,” Dobbs said. “But we need to blame the law, the law that allowed this man to go free.”</p>

 <p>Rapist <a class="various" data-fancybox-type="iframe" href="review/watson.html"> Mark Watson</a> had been out of prison just one day when he sexually assaulted another woman near Gainesville.</p>

<p>Freddie Clemons had been free only two months when he attacked and murdered a janitor in her Tampa middle school.</p>

<p><a class="various" data-fancybox-type="iframe" href="review/justiz.html"> Lazaro Justiz,</a> released from the state’s sex predator treatment center, lasted three months before he molested a 12-year-old boy in Lake Worth.</p>

<p>These repeat sex offenders show how <a class="various" data-fancybox-type="iframe" href="review/jimmy.html"> Florida’s Jimmy Ryce law</a> has failed at every level, a Sun Sentinel investigation found.</p>

<p>The law, enacted in 1999 and named after a murdered South Florida boy, was supposed to protect the public by sending the most dangerous rapists and child molesters to a treatment center after they finish their prison sentences.</p>

<p>But a series of shortcomings — missed opportunities, reluctant juries, and the imprecise science of evaluating sex offenders — have combined to turn dangerous predators loose.</p>

<p>Florida’s Department of Children & Families is recommending fewer and fewer sex offenders for confinement, falling from a high of 228 in 2000 to a low of 19 in 2012, the newspaper uncovered.</p>

<p>Watson, Clemons and Justiz were among 594 men identified by the Sun Sentinel who were reviewed and set free in the 14 years since the law took effect, only to be convicted of another sex crime.</p>

<p class="noindent"><i class="icon-circle"></i> Florida now recommends confinement for so few suspected predators — just one of every 150 offenders screened last year — that its rate is the lowest of 17 states with similar laws.</p>

<p class="noindent"><i class="icon-circle"></i> As the treatment center filled up, the state changed its profile of who should be locked up.</p>

<p class="noindent"><i class="icon-circle"></i> Even when the Department of Children & Families identifies offenders as sexually violent predators, the chances of persuading judges and juries to lock them up are no better than the flip of a coin: 50-50.</p>

<p>The Jimmy Ryce law has cost Florida taxpayers more than $450 million since it went into effect in 1999.</p>

<p>“I don’t think the costs would ever be too much if we were being successful,” said Esther Jacobo, interim secretary of the Department of Children & Families. “But it sounds to me like we don’t know that we’re getting our bang for the money, and we’ve got to figure out how to make that happen.”</p>

<a id="aerials"><h3>The goal: neutralizing the most dangerous</h3></a>

<p>The Ryce law grew out of a nationwide movement in the 1990s to stop repeat sex offenders. Called civil commitment, the concept is similar to involuntarily confining dangerous mentally ill patients for the protection of society: Sexual predators with impulses they can’t control are sent to <a class="fancybox-buttons" data-fancybox-group="button4" rel="gallery4" href="img/ryce1.jpg" title="Aerial of the Florida Civil Commitment Center in Arcadia.

<p>Florida’s law is aimed at the most dangerous sex offenders, those “who are just obsessed and not going to stop,’’ said Fort Lauderdale psychologist John Morin, who has evaluated sex offenders for the state for more than a decade. “As the prison doors are clanging behind them, they’re thinking about committing a new sex crime.’’</p>

<p>Critics say civil commitment unfairly deprives offenders of their freedom after they’ve served their sentences. But such laws have withstood constitutional challenges.</p>

<p>Before the Jimmy Ryce law, dangerous sex offenders got out of prison and returned only if they committed another crime. Now, they’re supposed to be identified and kept locked up so they can’t hurt anyone else.</p>

<p>The law is not intended to stop all sex offenders who might attack again, just the "small but extremely dangerous" group of violent repeat predators.</p>

<p>The process requires three steps — a screening by the Department of Children & Families, a psychological evaluation and a trial. Once committed, sex predators remain at the Florida Civil Commitment Center in Arcadia until a judge allows their release.</p>

<p>To identify where the system fails, the Sun Sentinel looked at the 594 offenders released at any stage during the 14-year period and later convicted of new sex crimes. The paper’s analysis showed:</p>

<p class="noindent"><i class="icon-circle"></i> 84 percent of these men were released by state screeners at the first stage of the process.</p>

<p class="noindent"><i class="icon-circle"></i> 11 percent were set free after state psychologists evaluated them.</p>

<p class="noindent"><i class="icon-circle"></i> 5 percent made it to the final stage of the commitment process, but were freed by judges or juries.</p>

<p>All went on to sexually violate someone new.</p>

<h3>Predators slip through</h3>

<p>The Department of Children & Families, through its sexually violent predator program, is responsible for evaluating sex offenders before they’re released from prison and determining whether inmates may be sex predators who warrant continued confinement.</p>

<p>Department psychologists screen offenders’ psychiatric and criminal records and decide whether they should be referred to the next step: a face-to-face evaluation by an independent psychologist. Those evaluations are then reviewed by a team from the department that decides whether to recommend to prosecutors that inmates be confined in the state’s 720-bed treatment facility.</p>

<p>For inmates to be committed to the center, prosecutors must convince judges or juries in civil trials that these men are likely to attack again if released.</p>

<p>The Sun Sentinel found dangerous offenders are freed at each step, starting at the initial screening by the Department of Children & Families. The agency applies a stricter definition of a sex predator than the one in the law, which requires a conviction for a violent sex crime and a mental condition that makes the inmate likely to reoffend.</p>

<p>Department screeners limit their search to inmates with multiple offenses, those who are “unusually prolific and/or egregious in their sexual offending,’’ Sandi Lewis, a Department of Children & Families psychologist, stated in a <a class="various" data-fancybox-type="iframe" href="review/email.html"> September 2012 email.</a> The agency, Lewis wrote, looks for rapists with “multiple documented violent sexual assaults’’ and pedophiles with multiple victims who show “a pattern of cruising for victims or manipulating them with elaborate grooming rituals.’’</p> 

<p>Other factors, including money and bed capacity at the treatment center, have influenced the department’s screening decisions. </p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="row-fluid" class="infinite-container">
<div class="span6 offset1" id="story" class="infinite-item">

<p>Suzonne Kline, former administrator of the sexually violent predator program, told the Sun Sentinel that when she took over in 2008, the state’s new $62 million treatment center in Arcadia was nearing completion.</p> 

<p>“It was expected to be overpopulated before we moved in,’’ Kline said. </p>

<p>She said she narrowed the predator profile used by department screeners, resulting in fewer sex offenders selected for further review and a savings to the state of $500,000 to $1 million a year on psychological evaluations. “Budgetary concerns are always an issue when you’re running a program,’’ Kline said.</p>

<p>Predators the department missed in this initial screening phase include child molester William Salisbury.</p>

<p>Salisbury had been convicted of two child sex offenses when screeners reviewed his paperwork. Nine months after his 2002 release, Salisbury lured a kindergartner from a Naples park, promising him a scooter. He carried the child to his truck, drove to a wooded area and raped him.</p>

<a id="sentencing"></a><p>Before police caught up to him, Salisbury had snatched a second child from his front yard. The 6-year-old boy was found hours later, wandering on a road, miles from his home.</p>

<p>“The reason we have these sex offender laws is for people like him,’’ prosecutor Steve Maresca <a class="fancybox-media" href="http://vimeo.com/72460669"><i class="icon-facetime-video"></i> said at Salisbury’s sentencing.</a> “It’s every parent’s nightmare.”</p>

<p>Dan Montaldi, current director of the state’s sexually violent predator program, said screeners make the best decisions they can with the information available at the time. Signs of future violence are not always apparent.</p>

<p>“If somebody does a horrendous thing, you can always look into his history and say, ‘Can’t you see he was going to do that?'" Montaldi said. “What we all tend to forget, though, is if you take this out, the day before he did that...[he] could have looked like a thousand other guys."</p>

<p>Predators who make it to the second stage of review, an evaluation by a state-contracted psychologist, can still slip through.</p> 

<p>The science behind sex offender evaluations is inexact. Tools used to score offenders’ risk of continued sexual violence are considered by researchers to be “moderately accurate’’ statistically, and most inmates, aware that their liberty is at stake, lie about their sexual urges and attractions. </p>

<p>The best psychologists can do is fit them into groups according to risk factors, much like the insurance industry projects life expectancy based on a person’s medical history or whether someone is a smoker.</p>

<p>“We never really know with any certainty,’’ Morin said. “Every person is different, the evaluators are different and they’re applying their own thinking.’’</p>

<p>A team of department psychologists reviews the evaluations and decides if inmates are predators likely to reoffend. Offenders the team found did not qualify include <a class="various" data-fancybox-type="iframe" href="review/sailor.html">rapist Tommy Sailor.</a></p>

<p>Sailor had been to prison for raping two women in two weeks in 1994, and a third rape charge was dropped. He passed a psychological evaluation and a second state screening. Sailor was out of prison five months when in 2010 he offered a ride to a woman he’d just met, took her to his Port Tampa home and raped her.</p>

<p>Even when the department identifies an offender as a predator who should remain locked up, cases often don’t hold up in court.</p>

<p>Of the 1,500 the state has tried to commit to the treatment center since the Jimmy Ryce law took effect in 1999, nearly half have been freed by the courts.</p>

<p>Judges dismiss cases before trial because they do not meet the legal requirements for commitment. Prosecutors settle or decline to pursue hard-to-win cases, and juries vote to release inmates.</p>

<p>Unlike criminal trials, in which jurors are asked to judge guilt or innocence for something that’s already occurred, jurors hearing Jimmy Ryce cases must assess what convicts might do — after they’ve served their prison terms.</p>

<p>“A lot of people look at this law as punishment because they’ve done their time and now we’re locking them up again,’’ said Sheila Rapa, a Fort Lauderdale psychologist and Jimmy Ryce evaluator since 2006. “It’s a huge leap for juries to have to make.’’</p>

<h3>Florida last in commitment referrals</h3>

<p>The number of predators Florida recommends for lock-up at the treatment center has steadily dropped.</p>

<p>In the first 11 years of the Jimmy Ryce law, the state identified an average of 128 potential predators each year. That number began declining in 2010 to an average of 49.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="row-fluid" class="infinite-container">
<div class="span6 offset1" id="story" class="infinite-item">

<p>Last year, the Department of Children & Families reviewed 2,926 inmates and recommended commitment for 19.</p>

<p>Florida’s referral rate is the lowest of 17 states with comparable sex-offender programs and at least three times lower than that of such large states as California, New York and Illinois, the Sun Sentinel found.</p>

<p>Florida’s dead-last ranking has the new head of the Department of Children & Families concerned that the state has missed predators who should have been confined. “I want to know exactly why that occurred,’’ said Esther Jacobo, interim secretary of the department.</p>

<p>Referrals dried up so much that prosecutors in Palm Beach County received no new cases in 2012, Broward just one, and Miami-Dade, the state’s most populous county, got two.</p>

<p>On May 24, the Sun Sentinel asked about the drop in referrals. Montaldi said it was a result of factors including research showing older offenders are less dangerous and an overall decline in sex crimes.</p>

<p>In early June, Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle also raised concerns about the shrinking referrals to Jacobo’s predecessor.</p>

<p>On June 13, the department set a record for a single day, recommending 19 sex offenders for commitment, tying the total for all of 2012.</p>

<p>The spike followed an internal review “to ensure DCF is taking all measures to protect Floridians from sexual predators,’’ department spokesman Whitney Ray wrote in an email to the Sun Sentinel.</p>

<p>Sixteen of the 19 men the department found eligible for commitment on that day in June had already been reviewed with a different outcome — the agency found they were not dangerous predators. They had not yet been released from prison, giving the state an opportunity to reconsider.</p>

<p>That sort of change is proof Florida needs a more uniform and objective method of deciding who makes the cut, said Robin Wilson, former clinical director at the state’s treatment center.</p>

<p>“The process,’’ he said, “shouldn’t be so flexible as you can look at the file one day and then come up with a completely different decision the next day.’’</p>

<p>The Department of Children & Families noted that violent sex crimes have declined in Florida since the law took effect. “This decline cannot be directly attributed to the (Jimmy Ryce) program as there are far more factors in play, but it does show that … sexually violent crime has decreased,” Ray said.</p>

<p>Jacobo has <a class="fancybox-media" href="https://vimeo.com/72486213"><i class="icon-facetime-video"></i> ordered a review</a> of her agency’s handling of sex offender screenings that will include contacting other states to see how Florida compares. She also plans to ask prosecutors how the state can improve.</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s bigger than just our evaluations,’’ Jacobo said. “Maybe it’s the whole way that we have written and applied the law.’’</p>

<p>Police and prosecutors were astonished that the state missed the chance to lock up the man who nearly killed her.</p>

<p>Chad Barger had attacked three women in two weeks when he was 14. His probation officer called him “the most dangerous individual this officer has supervised in his 11 years.”</p>

<p>As his prison release date neared in 2000, Barger came up for review under the <a class="various" data-fancybox-type="iframe" href="review/jimmy.html"> Jimmy Ryce law,</a> which allows the state to confine sex predators at a treatment center after their prison sentences end.</p>

<p>Florida’s Department of Children & Families concluded <a class="various" data-fancybox-type="iframe" href="review/barger.html">Barger</a> wasn’t a sexually violent predator, so he went free.</p>

<p>He’d been out of prison 11 months when he broke into Victoria’s apartment in January 2001.</p>

<p>For 90 minutes, he raped and tortured her.</p>

<p>“He beat me with pool sticks, with bottles, with all kinds of stuff. He cut me for fun,’’ she said. “He poured nail polish on me to set me on fire. He hammered a (broken) bottle in my back. He cut my head off, or tried to. . . . What if he would have?’’</p>

<p>As a juvenile, Dionte Davis raped a woman at knifepoint and later went to prison for attempting to break into a second woman’s home. When he came up for review under the Jimmy Ryce law in 2008, state screeners judged him low-risk.</p>
<p>He’d been free three months when he broke into Alexander’s house through a guest-bedroom window.</p>
<p>“I heard something,’’ she recalled. “When I turned the light on, he was right there in my bedroom on his knees. I hollered, ‘Oh my God, get out of here! Get out of here!’ ’’</p>

<p>Armed with a .38-caliber pistol, Davis fired one shot into Alexander’s cheek, below her left eye. A second bullet passed through the side of her face, exiting behind her ear.</p>


<p>“Oh my God! Lord have mercy!’’ she remembers screaming, each time he shot her.</p>

<p>She was so badly injured she could hardly recognize herself in police crime scene photos.</p>

<p>“I was (his) third victim,” Alexander said. “If they hadn’t let him out, this wouldn’t have happened to me.”</p>

<p>Crimes so reprehensible rarely happen in rural Madison County, just south of the Georgia border. With her nearest neighbor a quarter-mile away, Alexander lived alone next to cornfields in a home where she raised three children and planned to one day retire.</p>

<p>“All these years I’ve been here by myself, ain't nobody bothered me,’’ she said. “I just don’t understand why that boy would want to come in here and hurt me.’’</p>

<p>Now 70, she spends her days at a senior center “to keep me from being home by myself, and make me feel better.’’</p>

<h3>A family suffers</h3>

<p>Ophelia Redden isn’t alive to tell her story.</p>

<p>The Pahokee woman was sexually assaulted, strangled and beaten to death by convicted rapist James Harmon.</p>

<p>The state had determined Harmon was a danger and committed him to the sex predator treatment center in 2008, but a judge found him safe for release two years later.</p>

<p>He had been out seven months when he attacked Redden, 52, as she walked home one night in January 2011.</p>

<p>The dual shock of losing Redden and the horrific way she died devastated her three daughters, and the two grandchildren she dropped off and picked up at the school bus stop every day.</p>

<p>“My kids just shut down,’’ said daughter Tanzareka Redden. “They wouldn’t talk. They didn’t want to play.’’</p>

<p>The children, now 11 and 9, still cry for their grandmother and ask why she left them, the West Palm Beach woman said. “I’ll say, ‘It wasn’t her. You got to remember she will always be in your heart. Your grandma will always love you.’ ’’</p>

<p>A Fort Lauderdale native, Ophelia Redden was a gregarious woman, always ready to lend a hand or cook a meal for friends or family in Pahokee, a small farming community in western Palm Beach County. She collected coffee cups and teddy bears.</p>

<p>“She was a ball of energy,’’ said daughter Shantoria Redden, of West Palm Beach. “She always supported us in everything we did.’’</p>

<p>The Sun Sentinel shared its investigative findings with experts, who said Florida could do more to protect the public from repeat sex offenders.</p> 

<p>The newspaper’s eight-month investigation found that Florida had missed opportunities to lock up sex offenders under the Jimmy Ryce law, which allows the state to confine the most dangerous rapists and child molesters at a treatment center. In the 14 years the law has been in effect, Florida released at least 594 sex offenders who were later convicted of new sex crimes.</p> 

<a id="track"></a><p>Experts — professors who have researched sex offenders, psychologists who have evaluated them, and those who have worked at sex offender treatment centers — suggested specific actions the state can take.</p> 

<h3>Track rearrests, failures</h3>

<p>No agency is required to track sex offenders who are screened and released under the Jimmy Ryce law to see if they’re arrested for new sex crimes, despite state audits recommending that as far back as 2000.</p> 

<p>The Department of Children & Families just began looking at recidivism but has no results. Tracking thus far has consisted mainly of mining headlines in the news.</p> 

<p>“Sometimes you read in the media of a sex offender being arrested, and then what we’ll do is check to see if he was one of ours,’’ said Dan Montaldi, director of the agency’s sexually violent predator program.</p> 

<p>The state should examine cases resulting in rearrests, starting with those identified by the Sun Sentinel, experts said. The state will do that, said Esther Jacobo, interim secretary of the Department of Children & Families.</p> 

<a id="assess"></a><p>“Where we could do a better job is when cases fail to go back and really look carefully at the chain of events and figure out what could have been done differently,’’ said Jill Levenson, a Lynn University professor and sex offender researcher. “Was there a place where somebody erred, or where some more extensive assessment or background check might have revealed something telling?’’</p> 

<h3>Assess costs, benefits</h3>

<p>Each year, Florida spends about $34 million on Jimmy Ryce screenings, commitment trials and confinement of predators at the treatment center. Since the law took effect in 1999, the total public tab has topped $450 million, and the state cannot even say how effective the law has been.</p> 

<p>That’s akin to a company spending half a billion dollars on a product or strategy without any research on whether it works.</p> 

<p>“From a business perspective, it’s unconscionable,’’ said Daniel Mears, a professor of criminology at Florida State University.</p> 

<p>More than 750 high-risk sex offenders have been ordered to the treatment center, potentially preventing crimes they would have committed. But twice as many were released and arrested again for sex offenses, the Sun Sentinel found.</p> 

<a id="monitor"></a><p>“There’s people getting missed that go on and do horrible things,’’ Mears said. For the money spent, “there’s a lot of things we could be doing for a much larger swath of the sex offender population.’’</p> 

<h3>Monitor released offenders</h3>

<p>Florida should create a system for supervising all sex predators released from the treatment center. Now, they’re simply freed and monitored only if they are still on probation for their criminal charges.</p>

<p>“There are a number of guys who will be released from the center who won’t have any sex offender probation and won’t have any mandated follow-up, which to me just sounds crazy,’’ said Robin Wilson, a psychologist and former clinical director at the center.</p> 

<a id="know"></a><p>Other states with civil commitment require community supervision for released sex predators that involves close monitoring and continued treatment, a step that legislative auditors have recommended for Florida but lawmakers have yet to approve.</p> 

<p>Some offenders released from Florida’s treatment center aren’t even on the state’s sex offender registry, the Sun Sentinel found.</p>

<h3>Treatment — know what works</h3>

<p>Civil commitment is still relatively new, and Florida has no evidence of how well the treatment being provided works.</p> 

<p>“There needs to be a way of determining the effectiveness,’’ said psychologist Harry Krop, who evaluates sex offenders under the Ryce law. The state should follow offenders released from the center “so we can really make a determination whether the recidivism rate is reduced.’’</p> 

<a id="oversight"></a><p>To reach a broader group of offenders, treatment should start in prison, Wilson said. Waiting until an offender is so dangerous he’s confined to the treatment center, he said, “is like giving a guy an aspirin five days after a headache.’’</p> 

<h3>Create an oversight system</h3>

<p>Other states, including Illinois and California, have sex offender management boards that meet and recommend improvements in all areas, from supervision to treatment and civil commitment. The goal: keeping the public safe from sex offenders.</p> 

<p>“We don’t have one,’’ Wilson said, “and we should.’’</p>
