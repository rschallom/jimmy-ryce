    <h4>The following is an excerpt of an email sent from a Department of Children & Families psychologist to a prosecutor describing the criteria considered when determining if a sex offender is a predator.</h4>
  
<p>SVPP Approach:</p>

<p>The Sexually Violent Predator Program (SVPP) has a screening team of four
psychologists responsible for selecting files for full evaluation.
Hundreds of files are screened each month. The Multidisciplinary Team
includes screeners, consulting psychologists, and the evaluators for the
case. Screeners and other members of the Multidisciplinary Team have
examined tens of thousands of files on sex offenders with the aim of
identifying which ones stand out as exceptionally dangerous because of
impairment secondary to disorder (usually a particularly severe
manifestation of paraphilia). The evaluation selection and commitment
recommendation process is guided by the Legislative findings and intent
section of the statute, with an emphasis on identifying the "small but
extremely dangerous number" of individuals tending to be unusually prolific
and/or egregious in their sexual offending in comparison to most sex
offenders.</p>

<p>The Team looks for atypical, exceptional sex offenders who stand out from
his peers. This tends to be a relatively small group of persons; enough to
give Florida, the nation's fourth most populous state, the nation's second
largest SVP facility census. In contrast, sex offenders with at least two
sex offenses (Le., sexual recidivists) number in the thousands. They may
minimally meet clinical criteria for paraphilia according to diagnostic
manuals but they are not exceptional as such. The same is true for sex
offenders scoring in at least the moderate-high range on sex offender
actuarial risk assessment instruments (the Static-99R), and also true for
generally violent criminals, many of whom have at least one sex offense
somewhere in their diverse criminal histories (as well as domestic
violence). Similarly large in number is the group of all sex offenders who
will probably reoffend eventually in some way or other at least one more
time in their lifetimes. In contrast, the group of offenders likely to
resume repetitive and even frequent sexual offending ("repeat acts") if
released is relatively small in number. SVPP is primarily concerned to
identify those offenders.</p>

<p>The group SVPP seeks to identify consists of individuals who can be
expected to resume their pattern of offending fairly soon after release,
given the severity of the sexual disorder that drives them. These
individuals usually will have extensive sexual criminal histories with
multiple documented sex offenses of a predatory, violent or severe nature.
Their patterns give evidence of a preoccupying or entrenched sexual
disorder that drives the offender to not only exploit opportunities but to
repeatedly seek out or create opportunities for sexual crimes. These
individuals tend to be sexual hunters. When they are rapists these
offenders usually have multiple documented violent sexual assaults showing
similar features across assaults, suggesting the rapes are fantasy driven
(intense fantasies and urges make up the sexual disorder). When they are
offenders against children they will usually have more victims than the
typical person with offenses against children, as well as a pattern of
cruising for victims or manipulating them with elaborate grooming rituals.
These atypical offenders against children are often exclusive pedophiles
whose paraphilic disturbance is deeply entrenched. They have little or no
capacity for adult attractions. In other cases, the individual may have
some attraction to adults but prefers children. Most of his sexual energy
is focused on children. Exclusive or preferential pedophiles will often
have offended against the children in their families and family
acquaintances, but also have multiple victims outside of this circle.</p>

<p>Overall, the sexual crimes of this small number of offenders tend to
involve extensive physical violation of victims or physical damage, e.g.,
penetration, multiple sex acts on a victim during the same criminal
episode, threats of death or violence, weapons, bondage, or acts of
physical violence. Past crimes have been severe on a repeated basis, such
that the evidence indicates a very high likelihood of the offender resuming
much the same pattern of driven, frequent and severe offending. High
sexual excitement and prior fantasizing tend to be the primary motivating
force for these offenders, as opposed to retaliation or revenge, control
(unless the control is sexually arousing as such), domination (as in
domestic violence) or typical criminal opportunism. The victims of such
offenders often include strangers, often multiple strangers, or unrelated
persons with whom the offender has created relationships for specific
purpose of sexual offending.</p>

<p>Not every offender selected for evaluation or recommended for commitment
will have every feature of this description. Selection and recommendation
criteria do not function as bright line rules. Screeners and
Multidisciplinary Team members use clinical judgment and give many factors
careful consideration as they interact and come together in the particular
case at hand. Some cases selected for evaluation and recommended for
commitment do not involve as much offense-severity as others, but might
involve more prolific offending. Other cases involve less prolific
offending but the type of sexual offense is more severe, with at least some
repetitive offending at this level of severity.</p>

<p>Not every case selected for evaluation or ultimately recommended for
commitment involves a chronic, acute sexual disorder (paraphilia) but most
do. The relatively few exceptions of cases recommended for commitment that
do not involve paraphilia tend to be instances of personality disturbance
specifically oriented toward frequent sexual violence, as opposed to a
general criminal orientation in which the person's sex offenses are similar
to his more frequent non-sexual offenses, e.g., whimsical, impulsive, or
opportunistic (rather than driven, premeditated, and patterned).</p>

<p>The case of Kenneth Bargeron:</p>

<p>This was the individual's third referral. He waS first referred in 1999,
but he was not recommended for evaluation, In 2009 he was evaluated and MDT
recommended he met criteria, A petition was filed, but voluntarily
dismissed on the day he was sentenced to a new term in Department of
Corrections, He was most recently referred on 3/27/12, He was recommended
for evaluation, but Dr. Carr opined he does not meet criteria. On September
7, 2012, the MDT concluded Mr. Bargeron did not meet criteria,
After review of the available information, including legal documents and
previous reports from the evaluators, the SVPP MDT has determined that Mr.
Bargeron's sex offenses did not appear to be highly predatory in nature,
His charges included offenses against familial and known victims, as
opposed to strangers, Additionally, his offenses did not include physical
violence, Overall, the available information suggests Mr. Bargeron does not
appear to be a sexually violent predator.</p>

<p>I hope this response is helpful.</p>
