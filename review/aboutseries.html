    <h4>About this investigation</h4>
  
    <p>The Sun Sentinel set out to examine the effectiveness of the Jimmy Ryce law by determining the number of sex offenders released under the law who went on to commit new sex crimes.</p>

<p>The newspaper obtained a database from the Florida Department of Children & Families of inmates screened since the law took effect in 1999, more than 31,000 individuals.</p> 

<p>Names, birth dates and screening dates were submitted to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The agency matched those against a statewide criminal history database and found 1,384 offenders had been rearrested on sex charges as of April 15. The number may be higher because arrest records do not always list the charge, the agency cautioned.</p>

<p>In comparison, 759 sex offenders have been committed to the state’s sex predator treatment center. That means for every one committed, nearly two others were released and then arrested on a sex charge.</p>

<p>To identify offenders who have been convicted of a new sex offense, the Sun Sentinel compared the names, birth dates and screening dates with the Florida Department of Corrections database of felony convictions. Reporters also checked news clips of sex offender arrests.</p>

<p>That process identified 594 men. Convictions for probation violations and failure to register as a sex offender were not counted. The tally includes sex-related murders but excludes 49 murders that did not appear to be sexually motivated.</p>

<p>The Sun Sentinel findings present only a partial picture of sexual reoffending since the data do not include arrests in other states or on federal charges. Also, research indicates many sex crimes are not reported and therefore would not result in an arrest or conviction.</p>

<p>More than half of the 31,000 individuals screened under the Ryce law had limited ability to commit more sex crimes in Florida, according to corrections records and Florida’s sex offender registry. About 10,000 returned to prison after being reviewed, 1,800 were never released, and more than 4,800 died, were deported or moved to another state.</p> 

<p>About 7,600 are living in Florida, and the whereabouts of another 5,500 are unknown. At least 130 are listed as fugitives.</p>
