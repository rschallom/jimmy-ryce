    <p>1/14/2002: The inmate advised that when he is around children he gets aroused and an erection and has to masturbate.  NCIC [National Crime Information Center] report shows a 1983 Assault/Battery, but neither the SAO or the Broward County Sheriff's Office had any record of this crime.  Inmate violated probation in 1998 for failing to complete sex offender treatment, not reporting, and for having his 6 year old daughter with him and not returning her when he was supposed to.  Inmate was not allowed to be around children.  There was also a report filed because inmate was talking to a 10 year old girl telling her that she was pretty and had nice legs.</p>
