    <h4>About the Jimmy Ryce case</h4>
  
<p>Jimmy Ryce disappeared on Sept. 11, 1995, after a school bus dropped him off near his home in south Miami-Dade County.</p>

<p>Juan Carlos Chavez, a ranchhand who later told police he became aroused by a group of young boys playing near a canal, spotted Jimmy and forced him into his truck at gunpoint.</p>

<p>Chavez took the terrified fifth-grader to his trailer and raped him. He told police he drove the boy back to where he’d abducted him, intending to drop him off, but got frightened when he saw police in the area.</p>

<p>Chavez returned to the trailer with Jimmy. When a helicopter flew overhead, Jimmy dashed for the trailer door, and Chavez shot him.</p>

<p>He dismembered the boy’s body and buried it in planters on a nearby farm. Police arrested Chavez three months later after his landlord discovered Jimmy’s backpack in the trailer closet. Chavez, who had no prior criminal record in the United States, is now 46 and on Florida’s Death Row.</p>

<p>Jimmy’s parents, Don and Claudine Ryce, lobbied for a law to stop sex predators. The Jimmy Ryce Act passed in 1998 and took effect the following January.</p>

<p>The law requires the state to evaluate sex offenders before they’re released from prison and keep the most dangerous confined at a treatment center. The state’s Department of Children & Families reviews inmates and decides which ones to recommend for continued confinement.</p>
 
<p>If prosecutors agree, they file a commitment petition in civil court, and the inmates are transferred from prison to the state’s 720-bed treatment center in Arcadia while their case proceeds. To be committed, a judge or jury must find the inmates are sexually violent predators as defined in the law -- offenders who have at least one conviction for a violent sex crime and a mental condition that makes them likely to reoffend.</p>
 
<p>Once committed, predators remain at the treatment center indefinitely. They’re entitled to annual reviews and are released by courts after a finding that their mental condition has changed, and they’re no longer likely to commit violent sex crimes.</p>
