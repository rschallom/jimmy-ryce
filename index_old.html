  	<p>Another child is dead. This time, a brown-haired, brown-eyed girl, just a year younger than Jimmy Ryce.</p>

<p>A 1999 law passed in Jimmy’s name is meant to protect Floridians from known sex offenders by keeping the most dangerous among them locked up even after they finish their prison sentences.</p>
<p>But a XX-month Sun Sentinel investigation has uncovered a shocking record of failure. Rapists and child molesters have been freed by the hundreds to harm again, and left an appalling wake of carnage and suffering.</p>

  			<p>Among the newspaper’s findings, culled from thousands of pages of official records:</p>

	<p><i class="icon-circle pull-left"></i>From South Florida to the Panhandle, sexual predators the state failed to keep confined [IF THAT’S THE CORRECT PHRASING] raped 128 women, murdered 11 people and sexually assaulted 354 children when freed.</p>

	<p><i class="icon-circle pull-left"></i>At least 591 offenders screened under the Ryce law and deemed no- or low-risk [OR WHATEVER THE OFFICIAL JARGON IS ] went on to commit rape or a sexual offense on a child.</p>

	<p><i class="icon-circle pull-left"></i>Many offenders struck again within days of being freed. [DOES THIS SQUARE WITH THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE?] At least 138 committed a new sexual offense within six months, six the very day they walked out the prison gates.</p>

	<p>“That’s exactly what the law was designed to prevent,” said John Morin of Fort Lauderdale, one of the psychologists who XXX [BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THEIR ROLE UNDER THE LAW]. “It’s scandalous.”</p>

	<p>Just XXX weeks ago [June 21] a north Florida community mourned the loss of 8-year-old Cherish Perrywinkle, abducted from a Jacksonville Wal-Mart, raped and murdered. Her accused killer: a registered sex offender the state had ruled was not a violent sexual predator.</p> 

	<p>“A beautiful child died,” a pastor told the crowd assembled for Cherish’s wake and funeral. “She need not have died.” </p>

	<p>If the man arrested is guilty, it will be the latest breakdown of the social safeguards the 14-year-old Ryce law was supposed to create. </p>

	<p>After Jimmy, a 9-year-old Miami-Dade boy, was snatched from XXX and killed by a sexual predator, Florida’s elected leaders vowed: never again. The law named in his memory empowers the state to evaulate convicted sex criminals, and involuntarily confine those identified as the most dangerous at a treatment center in Central Florida after their release from prison.</p>

<p>Perodically, a horrible case makes the headlines and TV news. [INSERT MENTION OF A SENSATIONAL CASE OR 2 HERE, LIKE JESSICA? THE GIRL IN SARASOTA?] Until now, though, there had not been a comprehensive look at the Ryce law and its failings. </p>

	<p>The Sun Sentinel’s investigation established this sobering fact: for every sex offender the state has committed under the law, two others have been released and rearrested for a sexually related crime. </p>

	<p>“The people who are deciding whether or not these guys get loose, they’re gambling with people’s lives that they don’t even know,” said the angry owner of a North Florida veterinary clinic where an employee was brutally attacked RAPED? and killed by a freed sex offender.</p>

	<p>“There aren’t any higher stakes, are there?” she asked. “Innocent lives, innocent victims---children, women.”</p>

	<p>Under the Ryce law, it’s the Florida Department of Children & Families that’s responsible for identifying [POTENTIAL---SINCE A JURY HAS THE FINAL RULING?] predators --- offenders convicted of at least one sexually violent crime who also have a mental disorder [IS THIS THE LANGUAGE USED BY THE LAW---”MENTAL DISORDER?”] making them likely to attack again. Those inmates are referred to prosecutors for a jury trial where a unanimous verdict is required for commitment.</p>

	<p>The Sun Sentinel found this system can malfunction at every stage: predators have been turned loose because the state failed to identify them, or because judges or juries declined to keep them locked up. Other offenders were sent to the treatment center, but were freed later and attacked new victims. </p>

	<p>Five examples of how the Ryce law hasn’t failed, and the price paid by some Floridians.</p>

	  	<h3>‘He cut me for fun’</h3>
	  	<p>COCOA The 19-year-old college student awoke in the middle of the night to an intruder straddling her with a knife to her throat.</p>

		<p>For the next 90 minutes, Chad Barger raped and tortured his victim.</p>

		<p>“He smashed my face against the floor. He ripped my clothes off. Well, actually he cut my clothes off,” said Victoria, who asked to be identified only by her first name.</p>
		<p>“He beat me with pool sticks, with bottles, with all kinds of stuff,” she told the Sun Sentinel. “He cut me for fun. He poured nail polish remover on me, set me on fire, he hammered a bottle in my back. He tried to decapitate my head.”</p>

		<p>The state had the opportunity to prevent both attacks. In 1995, when Barger was 14, he attacked three women in two weeks. He ended up going to prison, but in 2000, when he was scheduled for release, DCF did not attempt to keep him confined under the Ryce law. Psychologist Ada Ramirez, who declined to discuss her evaulation with the Sun Sentinel, found he didn’t qualify for commitment.</p>

		<p>That was despite a dire warning from his probation officer in 1997 that Barger “is the most dangerous individual this officer has supervised in his 11 years.” The ex-convict was only out of prison for 11 months when he assaulted Victoria.</p>

		<p>Barbara Matthews, a Cocoa police officer who investigated Barger, is astonished that state officials passed up the chance to use the Ryce law keep him under lock and key.</p>

		<p>“What are they looking for that they missed this guy who showed over the years this patttern of aggression towards women, this history of violence and anger just constantly growing, as he did?” said Matthews.</p>

				<h3>‘Why was he still on the streets?’ </h3>

				<p>MADISON---Donte Davis went to prison after raping one woman at knifepoint, then attempting to break into a home where a second woman inside heard him and called police in time.</p>

				<p>But when he came up for review as a potential sexual reoffender, screeners from the Department of Children & Familes judged him a low-risk case, and didn’t even choose to order a psychological evaulation.</p>

				<p>He was freed in December 2009. Just over three months later, Davis broke the North Florida home of a great-grandmother, raped her, shot her in the face and tried to burn the evidence. He was 23; his victim, Eunice Alexander, 66.</p>

				<p>Armed with a .38-caliber pistol, Davis fired one bullet into Alexander’s cheek below her left eye, another CAN WE DESCRIBE WHERE IT ENTERED AND EXITED? [SALLY I COULDN’T TELL FROM YOUR DRAFT IF SHE WAS HIT by 2 or 3 BULLETS]</p> 

				<p>“Every time he shot me, I hollered, ‘Oh my God. Lord have mercy,’” Alexander recounted to the Sun Sentinel.</p>

				<p>Davis raped the bleeding, terrified woman, and torched her bed and clothes. He handed her a towel to wipe away his semen and filled a bread bag with ice. “He told me, ‘Put that on my eye. I’ll be all right,” she remembered.</p>

				<p>Then he was gone.</p>

				<p>At a 2011 trial, Davis was convicted OF WHAT and sentenced to life in prison. Alexander, now 70, blames the state for not keeping him locked up when it had the chance.</p>

				<p>‘I was the third victim,” she said. “If they hadn’t let him out this wouldn’t have happened to me.”</p>

				<p>Even Davis’s own defense lawyer is bewildered his client was set free into society.</p>

				<p>“Why was he still on the streets?” said Baya Harrison. “I wish I knew.”</p>

				<h3>‘He shouldn’t have been released’</h3>

				<p>PAHOKEE A neighbor found the body of Ophelia Redden under a melaleuca tree two blocks from the home where she raised three children. The 52-year-old woman had been sexually assaulted, beaten and strangled. </p>

				<p>One weapon the killer used: a blooded, broken garden hoe. Suspicion turned to a sexual predator released from the Jimmy Ryce center seven months before.</p>

				<p>James “Nardo” Harmon, a member of the South Side Boys gang, went to prison at 19 for two rapes. He served 13 years, then prosecutors sought to commit him under the Ryce law. A unanimous verdict by a Palm Beach County jury in July 2008 designated him a sexually violent predator, and he was sent o the treatment center.</p>

				<p>But by June 2010, he was free. Two psychologists had disagreed on whether it was safe to release him. Palm Beach Circuit Judge John Hoy ruled the state could no longer prove Harmon’s “mental condition remains such that it is not safe for [him] to be at large.”</p>

				<p>Harmon moved back to Pahokee, married, and within six months, Redden confided to a lifelong fiend that he was theatening her for sex.</p>

				<p>“He told her he was going to take it,” the friend, Edward Turner, recalled.</p>

				<p>Redden was last sent alive with Harmon at the Pahokee Liqour Store on Jan. 27, 2011. Harmon told Palm Beach County Sheriff’s detectives he was home watching “Avatar” with his wife, but she ultimately told investigators he was out that night.</p>

				<p>Harmon pleaded guilty in April 2012 to raping and killing Redden in a deal that sent him back to prison for 40 years. “I just hope that he don’t get a chance to harm nobody else,” Shantoria Redden, his victim’s daughter, said at the sentencing.</p>

				<p>Jillian Sweet, formerly of Jupiter, served on the Jimmy Rice jury that commited Harmon, and was aghast to learn from the Sun Sentinel that he had been let go.</p>

				<p>“It’s awful,” Sweet said. “I definitely thought he needed some psychiatic help. He shouldn’t have been released.”</p>
				
				<h3>‘You should get only so many chances’</h3>

				<p>ORANGE PARK At the start of the workday, employees at the Wells Road veterinary clinic made a terrifying discovery: the body of vet tech Andrea Boyer lay in a pool of blood on the floor of the dog kennl, her clothes torn off.</p>
				
				</div>
				</div>

				<div class = "row-fluid" class="infinite-container">
		<div class="span6 offset1" id="story" class="infinite-item">

				<p>‘I think somebody raped her and killed her,” a sobbing co-worker told a 911 operator. “She doesn’t have any pulse.” </p>

				<p>Boyer had been sexually assaulted, strangled until her neck was broken and bludgeoned with a fire extinguisher. The suspect, Michael R. Jackson, had been released from the Jimmy Ryce treatment center 13 months earlier.</p>

				<p>He had been already convicted of raping a 14-year-old at knifepoint and arrested after other attempted attacks on women. But prosecutors in Jacksonville agreed to let him go after two psychologists said he could safely live in the community.</p>
				
				<p>“When you look back, obviously we didn’t predict that well,” Harry Krop of Gainesville, one of the psychologists, said in an interview. </p>

				<p>The other psychologist, Dean Cauley, said the case epitomized the failings of the Jimmy Ryce law. Jackson had scored low on a commonly used risk assessment tool TEST? and received favorable reviews from mental health staff who treated him.</p>

				<p>“This is why the law doesn’t work because everything you look at with Mr. Jackson would tell you his risk had been reduced,” Cauley said.</p>
				
				<p>Jackson, now 43, was convicted of the January 2007 rape and murder of Boyer and sentenced to die. But the Florida Supreme Court overturned his conviction on a technicality IF THAT’S NOT AN ABUSIVE SIMPLIFICATION, and a retrial is scheduled this fall.</p>

				<p>Michal Harris, owner of the clinic where Boyer worked, is angry. </p>

				<p>“We seem to be making the same mistake over and over and over again,” the veterinarian said. ‘Why do they continue to release these guys when they obviously have very little ability to predict future behavior?”</p> 

				<p>Jackson’s earlier victim, who was 14 when he broke through a sliding glass door to rape her, told the Sun Sentinel she was speechless when she found out he had been released and suspected of yet another violent rape. </p>

				<p>“I was devastated,” she said. “The fact that he got out and was able to kill this girl, I think you should get only so many chances.” </p>

				<h3>‘We need to blame the law’</h3>

				<p>JACKSONVILLE Had the Jimmy Ryce law worked as intended, Cherish Perrywinkle, a cherubic second-grader, would still be alive _ riding her bike, playing school with her DO WE KNOW HOW MANY younger sisters, drawing pictures of monkeys and smiling girls. </p>

				<p>Unstead, she disappeared from a Wal-Mart, lured---police say---by a repeat sexual predator offering to buy her clothes and a hamburger. Her body was found 10 hours later in a marshy woods behind a church.</p>

				<p>The man accused of raping and strangling Cherish, Donald J. Smith, has a 36-year arrest history that includes molesting children and trying to lure girls into his car. He’d just been released from jail three weeks earlier on charges of impersonating a child welfare worker and trying to trick a mother into bringing him her young daughter.</p>

				<p>“Why is he out? Why?” asked Beverly McClaine of Jacksonsville, wiping tears as she stood before a memorial to Cherish made of balloons and stuffed animals. “She was an innocent baby. When’s it going to stop?” </p>

				<p>The state had two chances to commit Smith to the Jimmy Ryce treatment center. The first, in 1999, failed, ending in a dismissal [WE MEAN THE STATE TRIED BUT FAILED T PERSUADE A JURY OR JUDGE?] The second time, in 2006, he went free after a finding by DCF that he wasn’t a sexually violent predator.</p>

				<p>Smith befriended Cherish and her mother Rayne at a Dollar General store and drove them to a Wal-Mart. He told the mother “he was going to buy clothes for [Cherish] and her because he saw they were having a hard time,” a Jacksonville dheriff’s report says.</p>

				<p>Afetr two hours of shopping, Smith reportedly told the mother he was taking Cherish to a nearby McDonald’s, but instead led the child to the parking lot and whisked her away in his van. It was the last time she was seen alive.</p>

				<p>The heinous crime left a community and a family distraught. At the Paxon Revival Center Church, where Cherish occasionally worshipped and sang in the children’s ministry, her grief-stricken mother wailed at the sight of her daughter lavender coffin.</p>

				<p>From a stage with a full band and with the congregation on its feet, Pastor Steve Dobbs urged [CAN WE BE SPECIFIC HERE ABOUT WHAT HE SEEKS, SINCE THE LAW AND ITS FAILINGS ARE THE SUBJECT OF THE STORY.] </p>

				<p>“I know you want to blame the judge and you want to blame mama and you want to blame the cops,” Dobbs said. “But we need to blame the law, the law that allowed this man to go free.” </p>
